BakeJS aims to make combining multiple JS libraries when building a JS-powered application simple.  It does not, however, aim to simplify the process of creating that library through allowing you to concatenate local files together into a single JS library.  

If you are writing a JS library, then I would highly recommend checking out one of the following tools, or alternatively, use a simple makefile to concatenate your files into a single JS file.  For many people this is the simplest and most effective way.
