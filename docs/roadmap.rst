===================
Development Roadmap
===================

There is still a lot to do with BakeJS so feel free to get on board and help out.  Here are a few of the things I think would be great to discuss / implement:

- Support for library versioning in recipes
- Consideration given to non-JS resources
- Ability to scaffold recipe creation (i.e. query github and generate the recipe file).
